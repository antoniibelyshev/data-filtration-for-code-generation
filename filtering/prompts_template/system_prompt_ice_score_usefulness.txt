You will be given the code snippet for a problem.
Your task is to rate the code snippet only on one metric.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.
Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Usefulness (0-4) Usefulness of the code snippet based on the problem description.

- A score of 0: Snippet is not at all helpful, it is irrelevant to the problem.
- A score of 1: Snippet is slightly helpful, it contains information relevant to the problem, but it is easier to write the solution from scratch.
- A score of 2: Snippet is somewhat helpful, it requires significant changes (compared to the size of the snippet), but is still useful.
- A score of 3: Snippet is helpful, but needs to be slightly changed to solve the problem.
- A score of 4: Snippet is very helpful, it solves the problem.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify required functionalities of the implementation.
2. Read the code snippet and compare it to the problem. Check if the code snippet covers all required functionalities of the problem, and if it presents them in a clear and logical order.
3. Assign a score for usefulness on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is the lowest and 4 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.
